      <h1>About Maroon Raccoon</h1>

      <p>
        Hi, I’m Jake — the founder of Maroon Raccoon. I build clean, modern websites
        for people who want a strong online presence without the confusion,
        unnecessary costs, or technical runaround that often comes with web
        development.
      </p>
        <br></br>
      <p>
        I focus on clear communication, transparent pricing, and custom solutions
        that fit your needs — not templates or one-size-fits-all approaches.
        My goal is simple: make the process straightforward and deliver something
        you’re proud to share.
      </p>
        <br></br>
      <p>
        If you’re interested in working together, I’d love to hear about your
        project. Feel free to reach out through the{" "}
        <a href="/contact">contact page</a>, and we can talk through next steps.
      </p>
