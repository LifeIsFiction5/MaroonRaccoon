          Hi, I’m Jake — the founder of Maroon Raccoon. I build clean, modern
          websites for people who want a strong online presence without the
          confusion, unnecessary costs, or technical runaround that often comes
          with web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on clear communication, transparent pricing, and custom
          solutions that fit your needs — not templates or one-size-fits-all
          approaches. My goal is simple: make the process straightforward and
          deliver something you’re proud to share.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re interested in working together, I’d love to hear about your
          project. Reach out through the <a href="/contact">contact page</a> and
          we can talk through next steps.
